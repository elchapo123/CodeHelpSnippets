public class Main extends JavaPlugin {

    @Override
    public boolean onCommand(CommandSender sender, Command cmd, String label, String[] args) {
        if (cmd.getName().equalsIgnoreCase("example")) {
            sender.sendMessage("Sends a message to the command sender!");
            return true;
        }

        return false;
    }

}
```
